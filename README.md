CanIMakeItDataRequestor
=======================
Project to test requesting information from a running webservice. The app displays a "Get Stops" button to the user and sends a request to http://ec2-54-83-18-44.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/CanIMakeWebService/GetStops, to retrieve stop data for the LIRR. The server response will be printed to the screen in it's JSON format. The app will then parse the data and display stop data in a readable format.
